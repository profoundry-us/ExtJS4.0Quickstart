# ExtJS 4.0 Quickstart Guide #

Looking to get started with [Ext JS 4.0](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs4-preview/ "Ext JS 4.0 Preview")?
Look no futher! This quickstart is a complete project ready for you to modify to your heart's content. It
contains only the essentials. This means the few Ext Javascript files necessary for running an application in
debug mode and the CSS necessary to display properly.

At the moment, the code released by Sencha seems to be using the old Ext 3.0 themes, so I'll work on migrating
them to the 4.0, but I'm not sure how to use the build tools yet. If you know a thing or two about the
theming, feel free to fork this project, make the changes, and send me a pull request! I'll do my best to keep
this updated as Sencha releases the latest version of their 4.0 developer previews and beta releases!
